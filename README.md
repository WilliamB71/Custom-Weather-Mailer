**| Personalised Daily Weather Mailer |**

The weather mailer project involves integrating multiple APIs to gather weather and oceanographic data for generating daily weather snapshots. It utilises Python for coding the logic and data processing, while HTML formatting is employed to structure and style the content of the email. AWS Lambda is utilised for serverless execution, and EventBridge is used to trigger the mailer on a daily basis. Proficiency in API integration, data retrieval, scheduling tasks, Python programming, and HTML formatting is required for developing and maintaining the solution.
